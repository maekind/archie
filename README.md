## Google cloud configuration for Speech to text recognition
First of all, we must have a google developper account and to activate Speech to text API.
Then, we create credentials and download de credentials json file.
We have to paste the credentials file as google_cloud.json into the data/conf folder.

## Disclaimer
This is a working personal project in progress to test google cloud speech to text capabilities and speed up my skills in ASR programs.
